A candidate key is one that can uniquely identify each row of a table. Generally, a candidate key becomes the primary key of the table. If the table has more than one candidate key, one of them will become the primary key and the rest are called alternate keys.
<br>
<br>For example, the EmployeeID may uniquely identify a particular employee. If so, then the EmployeeID is a candidate key. The Social Security Number (SSN) can also be another candidate key, as it can also be used to define a unique row in the table. One of these candidate keys may be choosen as a primary key. If EmployeeID is choosen as a primary key, SSN will become an alternate key.
