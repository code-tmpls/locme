<div class="appQuestion"><b>1. SQL was developed as an integral part of</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
SQL - Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!

What Can SQL do?

<li>SQL can execute queries against a database</li>
<li>SQL can retrieve data from a database</li>
<li>SQL can insert records in a database</li>
<li>SQL can update records in a database</li>
<li>SQL can delete records from a database</li>
<li>SQL can create new databases</li>
<li>SQL can create new tables in a database</li>
<li>SQL can create stored procedures in a database</li>
<li>SQL can create views in a database</li>
<li>SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>3. SQL is (referring to it as a Programming Language)</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
<strong>SQL is a declarative language in which the expected result or operation is given without the specific details about how to accomplish the task.</strong> The steps required to execute SQL statements are handled transparently by the SQL database. Sometimes <strong>SQL is characterized as non-procedural</strong> because procedural languages generally require the details of the operations to be specified, such as opening and closing tables, loading and searching indexes, or flushing buffers and writing data to filesystems. Therefore, SQL is considered to be designed at a higher conceptual level of operation than procedural languages because the lower level logical and physical operations aren't specified and are determined by the SQL engine or server process that executes it.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>6. What are some properties of PL/SQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages. It was developed by Oracle Corporation in the early 90's to enhance the capabilities of SQL. PL/SQL is one of three key programming languages embedded in the Oracle Database, along with SQL itself and Java.

Another common SQL interview question regarding PL/SQL may come in a different form:

“What is the difference between SQL and PL/SQL?”
Difference between SQL and PL/SQL:

<li>SQL is a Structured Query Language used to issue a single query or execute a single insert/update/delete.</li>

<li>PL-SQL is a programming language SQL, used to write full programs using variables, loops,operators etc. to carry out multiple selects/inserts/updates/deletes.</li>

<li>SQL may be considered as the source of data for our reports, web pages and screens.</li>

<li>PL/SQL can be considered as the application language similar to Java or PHP. It might be the language used to build, format and display those reports, web pages and screens.</li>

<li>SQL is a data oriented language used to select and manipulate sets of data.</li>

<li>PL/SQL is a procedural language used to create applications.</li>

<li>SQL vs. PL-SQL</li>

<li>SQL is used to write queries, DDL and DML statements.</li>

<li>PL/SQL is used to write program blocks, functions, procedures triggers,and packages.</li>

<li>SQL is executed one statement at a time.</li>

<li>PL/SQL is executed as a block of code.</li>

<li>SQL is declarative, i.e., it tells the database what to do but not how to do it.</li>

<li>Whereas, PL/SQL is procedural, i.e., it tells the database how to do things.</li>

<li>SQL can be embedded within a PL/SQL program.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>10. Which of the following are valid SQL comments?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Comments are used to explain sections of SQL statements, or to prevent execution of SQL statements.

Single line comments start with -- .

Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).

The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   --Select all:
-   SELECT * FROM Customers;</code></pre>
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ .

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   /*Select all the columns
-   of all the records
-   in the Customers table:*/
-   SELECT * FROM Customers;</code></pre>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>11. Which SQL statement is used to extract data from a database?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
A SELECT statement retrieves zero or more rows from one or more database tables or database views.

As SQL is a declarative programming language, SELECT queries specify a result set, but do not specify how to calculate it.

The SELECT statement has many optional clauses:

<li>WHERE specifies which rows to retrieve.</li>

<li>GROUP BY groups rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.</li>

<li>HAVING selects among the groups defined by the GROUP BY clause.</li>

<li>ORDER BY specifies an order in which to return the rows.</li>

<li>AS provides an alias which can be used to temporarily rename tables or columns.</li>

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

<strong>SELECT Syntax</strong>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   SELECT column1, column2, ...
-   FROM table_name;</code></pre>
Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

The WHERE clause can be combined with AND , OR , and NOT operators.

The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE .

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR are TRUE .

The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE .

<div class="appQuestion"><b>22. How to select random 10 rows from a table?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The easiest way to generate random rows in MySQL is to use the ORDER BY RAND() clause.
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">SELECT * FROM tbl ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 10;</code></pre>
This can work fine for small tables. However, for big table, it will have a serious performance problem as in order to generate the list of random rows, MySQL need to assign random number to each row and then sort them.

Even if you want only 10 random rows from a set of 100k rows, MySQL need to sort all the 100k rows and then, extract only 10 of them.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>23. Examine the following code. What will the value of price be if the statement finds a NULL value? SELECT name, ISNULL(price, 50) FROM PRODUCTS</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
What is a NULL Value?

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

Note: It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

<strong>How can you return a default value for a NULL?</strong>

<strong>MySQL</strong>

The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
-   FROM Products</code></pre>
or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
-   FROM Products</code></pre>
<strong>SQL Server</strong>
The <code><b>SQL Server</b></code> ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL :

<li>SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))</li>
<li>FROM Products</li>
<strong>MS Access</strong>

The MS Access IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0) :

<li>SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))</li>
<li>FROM Products</li>
<strong>Oracle</strong>

The Oracle NVL() function achieves the same result:

<li>SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))</li>
<li>FROM Products</li>

 <div class="appQuestion"><b>24. Which operator is used to search for a specified text pattern in a column?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters

_ - The underscore represents a single character

Examples:

<li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a"</li>
<li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' -- Finds any values that ends with "a"</li>
<li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' -- Finds any values that have "or" in any position</li>
<li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' -- Finds any values that have "r" in the second position</li>
<li>WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length</li>
<li>WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' -- Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"</li>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
SELECT name, mark FROM Students ORDER BY mark DESC LIMIT 3;

You have to use ORDER BY to order students by their marks and then select just the first 3 records.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

<strong>The SQL SELECT TOP Clause</strong>

The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact on performance.

Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause<code><b>.MySQL supports the</b></code> LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while <strong>Oracle uses</strong> ROWNUM .

SELECT name, COUNT(name) FROM customers GROUP BY name

SQL aggregate functions like COUNT , AVG , and SUM have something in common: they all aggregate across the entire table. But what if you want to aggregate only part of a table? For example, you might want to count the customers having the same name. In situations like this, you’d need to use the GROUP BY clause. GROUP BY allows you to separate data into groups, which can be aggregated independently of one another.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>42. What is the difference between HAVING clause and WHERE clause?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Both specify a search condition but HAVING clause is used only with the SELECT statement and typically used with GROUP BY clause.

If GROUP BY clause is not used then HAVING behaves like WHERE clause only.

Here are some other differences:

HAVING filters records that work on summarized GROUP BY results.

HAVING applies to summarized group records, whereas WHERE applies to individual records.

Only the groups that meet the HAVING criteria will be returned.

HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is present.

WHERE and HAVING can be in the same query.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>45. What are different JOINS used in SQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->

There are several types of joins:

<strong>SQL INNER JOIN Keyword</strong>

The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

<strong>SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword</strong>

The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

<strong>SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword</strong>

The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

<strong>SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword</strong>

The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword return all records when there is a match in either left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!

<strong>SQL Self JOIN</strong>

A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

<strong>SQL CROSS JOIN</strong>

The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN .This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.


If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN , it functions like an INNER JOIN .

Yes. You can join multiple tables with inner join.

For example, for a Faculty table the lookup tables might be Division, with DivisionID as the PK, Country, with CountryID as the PK, and Nationality, with NationalityID as the PK.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>79. What is Collation in SQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
A collation is a set of rules that defines how to compare and sort character strings.

Detailed Explanation:

A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. A collation is a set of rules for comparing characters in a character set. Let's make the distinction clear with an example of an imaginary character set.

Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters: A, B, a, b. We give each letter a number: A = 0, B = 1, a = 2, b = 3. The letter A is a symbol, the number 0 is the encoding for A, and the combination of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.

Suppose that we want to compare two string values, A and B. The simplest way to do this is to look at the encodings: 0 for A and 1 for B. Because 0 is less than 1, we say A is less than B. What we've just done is apply a collation to our character set. The collation is a set of rules (only one rule in this case): “compare the encodings.” We call this simplest of all possible collations a binary collation.

But what if we want to say that the lowercase and uppercase letters are equivalent? Then we would have at least two rules: (1) treat the lowercase letters a and b as equivalent to A and B; (2) then compare the encodings. We call this a case-insensitive collation. It is a little more complex than a binary collation.

In real life, most character sets have many characters: not just A and B but whole alphabets, sometimes multiple alphabets or eastern writing systems with thousands of characters, along with many special symbols and punctuation marks. Also in real life, most collations have many rules, not just for whether to distinguish lettercase, but also for whether to distinguish accents (an “accent” is a mark attached to a character as in German Ö), and for multiple-character mappings (such as the rule that Ö = OE in one of the two German collations).

<div class="appQuestion"><b>80. What is true about an AUTO_INCREMENT column in SQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
AUTO_INCREMENT allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table. Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.
<strong>Syntax for MySQL</strong>

The following SQL statement defines the "ID" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   CREATE TABLE Persons (
-   ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
-   LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
-   FirstName varchar(255),
-   Age int,
-   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
-   );</code></pre>
<strong>Syntax for SQL Server</strong>

The following SQL statement defines the "ID" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   CREATE TABLE Persons (
-   ID int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
-   LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
-   FirstName varchar(255),
-   Age int
-   );</code></pre>
<strong>Syntax for Oracle</strong>

In Oracle the code is a little bit more tricky.

You will have to create an auto-increment field with the sequence object (this object generates a number sequence).

Use the following <strong>CREATE SEQUENCE syntax</strong>:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   CREATE SEQUENCE seq_person
-   MINVALUE 1
-   START WITH 1
-   INCREMENT BY 1
-   CACHE 10;</code></pre>
The code above creates a sequence object called seq_person, that starts with 1 and will increment by 1. It will also cache up to 10 values for performance. The cache option specifies how many sequence values will be stored in memory for faster access.

To insert a new record into the "Persons" table, we will have to use the nextval function (this function retrieves the next value from seq_person sequence):
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   INSERT INTO Persons (ID,FirstName,LastName)
-   VALUES (seq_person.nextval,'Lars','Monsen');</code></pre>
The SQL statement above would insert a new record into the "Persons" table. The "ID" column would be assigned the next number from the seq_person sequence. The "FirstName" column would be set to "Lars" and the "LastName" column would be set to "Monsen".

<div class="appQuestion"><b>81. What are valid constraints in MySQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

<li>NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value</li>

<li>UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different</li>

<li>PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE . Uniquely identifies each row in a table</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>85. What is CHECK Constraint?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a single column it allows only certain values for this column.

If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

<strong>SQL CHECK on CREATE TABLE</strong>

The following SQL creates a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is created. The CHECK constraint ensures that you can not have any person below 18 years:

<strong>MySQL:</strong>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   CREATE TABLE Persons (
-   ID int NOT NULL,
-   LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
-   FirstName varchar(255),
-   Age int,
-   CHECK (Age>=18)
-   );</code></pre>
<strong>SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:</strong>

<li>CREATE TABLE Persons (</li>
<li>ID int NOT NULL,</li>
<li>LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,</li>
<li>FirstName varchar(255),</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>86. What is the difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
UNIQUE vs PRIMARY KEY

Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>92. What are Indexes in SQL?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database very fast. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.

<strong>CREATE INDEX Syntax</strong>

Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:

<!-- Answer ::: START -->
One table can have only one clustered index but multiple nonclustered indexes.

Clustered indexes can be read rapidly rather than non-clustered indexes.

Clustered indexes store data physically in the table or view and non-clustered indexes do not store data in table as it has separate structure from data row.

<!-- Answer ::: START -->
SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands are used to implement privileges in SQL multiple user environments. The administrator of the database can grant or revoke privileges to or from users of database object like SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE , ALL etc.

GRANT Command: This command is used provide database access to user apart from an administrator.

<strong>Syntax</strong>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">-   GRANT privilege_name
-   ON object_name
-   TO {user_name|PUBLIC|role_name}

<div class="appQuestion"><b>98. What are a transaction's main controls?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
COMMIT command is used to permanently save any transaction into the database.

When we use any DML command like INSERT , UPDATE or DELETE , the changes made by these commands are not permanent, until the current session is closed, the changes made by these commands can be rolled back.

To avoid that, we use the COMMIT command to mark the changes as permanent.

Following is commit command syntax:
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">_COMMIT;_</code></pre>
_COMMIT;_
ROLLBACK command

This command restores the database to last committed state. It is also used with SAVEPOINT command to jump to a savepoint in an ongoing transaction.

If we have used the UPDATE command to make some changes into the database, and realise that those changes were not required, then we can use the ROLLBACK command to rollback those changes, if they were not committed using the COMMIT command.

Following is rollback command syntax:

ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;

SAVEPOINT command

SAVEPOINT command is used to temporarily save a transaction so that you can rollback to that point whenever required.

Following is savepoint command syntax:

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

In short, using this command we can name the different states of our data in any table and then rollback to that state using the ROLLBACK command whenever required.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>101. What are valid properties of the transaction?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The characteristics of these four properties as defined by Reuter and Härder are as follows:

<strong>Atomicity</strong>

Atomicity requires that each transaction be "all or nothing": if one part of the transaction fails, then the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the database) to be indivisible ("atomic"), and an aborted transaction does not happen.

<strong>Consistency</strong>

The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code), but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined rules.

<strong>Isolation</strong>

The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed sequentially, i.e., one after the other. Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on the concurrency control method (i.e., if it uses strict - as opposed to relaxed - serializability), the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.

<strong>Durability</strong>

The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>102. What happens if autocommit is enabled?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
If autocommit mode is enabled, each SQL statement forms a single transaction on its own. By default, most of DBMS start the session for each new connection with autocommit enabled, so they do a commit after each SQL statement if that statement did not return an error. If a statement returns an error, the commit or rollback behavior depends on the error.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
<strong>A view.</strong>

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL functions, WHERE , and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

<strong>CREATE VIEW Syntax</strong>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>106. Are views updatable using INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The SQL UPDATE VIEW command can be used to modify the data of a view.

All views are not updatable. So, UPDATE command is not applicable to all views. An updatable view is one which allows performing a UPDATE command on itself without affecting any other table.

When can a view be updated?

<li>The view is defined based on one and only one table.</li>

<li>The view must include the PRIMARY KEY of the table based upon which the view has been created.</li>

<li>The view should not have any field made out of aggregate functions.</li>

<li>The view must not have any DISTINCT clause in its definition.</li>

<li>The view must not have any GROUP BY or HAVING clause in its definition.</li>

<li>The view must not have any SUBQUERIES in its definitions.</li>

<li>If the view you want to update is based upon another view, the later should be updatable.</li>

<li>Any of the selected output fields (of the view) must not use constants, strings or value expressions.</li>

Triggers in SQL is kind of stored procedures used to create a response to a specific action performed on the table. You can invoke triggers explicitly on the table in the database.

Triggers are, in fact, written to be executed in response to any of the following events:

A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE , INSERT , or UPDATE )

A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE , ALTER , or DROP ).

A database operation (SERVERERROR , LOGON , LOGOFF , STARTUP , or SHUTDOWN ).

Action and Event are two main components of SQL triggers when certain actions are performed the event occurs in response to that action.
