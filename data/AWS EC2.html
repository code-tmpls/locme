Amazon EC2 uses public–key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public–key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair.

After configuring the AMI to prevent logging in using a password, you must make sure users can log in using another mechanism.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>36. How Is Stopping And Terminating An Instance Different From Each Other ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
<strong>Starting, stopping and terminating are the three states in an EC2 instance, let’s discuss them in detail:</strong>

<li>Stopping and Starting an instance: When an instance is stopped, the instance performs a normal shutdown and then transitions to a stopped state. All of its Amazon EBS volumes remain attached, and you can start the instance again at a later time. You are not charged for additional instance hours while the instance is in a stopped state.</li>
<li>Terminating an instance: When an instance is terminated, the instance performs a normal shutdown, then the attached Amazon EBS volumes are deleted unless the volume’s deleteOnTermination attribute is set to false. The instance itself is also deleted, and you can’t start the instance again at a later time.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>37. How Is A Spot Instance Different From An On-demand Instance Or Reserved Instance ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
First of all, let’s understand that Spot Instance, On-Demand instance and Reserved Instances are all models for pricing. Moving along, spot instances provide the ability for customers to purchase compute capacity with no upfront commitment, at hourly rates usually lower than the On-Demand rate in each region. Spot instances are just like bidding, the bidding price is called Spot Price.

The Spot Price fluctuates based on supply and demand for instances, but customers will never pay more than the maximum price they have specified. If the Spot Price moves higher than a customer’s maximum price, the customer’s EC2 instance will be shut down automatically.

But the reverse is not true, if the Spot prices come down again, your EC2 instance will not be launched automatically, one has to do that manually. In Spot and On demand instance, there is no commitment for the duration from the user side, however in reserved instances one has to stick to the time period that he has chosen.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>39. Can S3 Be Used With Ec2 Instances, If Yes, How ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Yes, it can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. By using Amazon S3, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. In order to execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, developers use the tools provided to load their Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and to move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Another use case could be for websites hosted on EC2 to load their static content from S3.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>40. If You Want To Launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (ec2) Instances And Assign Each Instance A Predetermined Private Ip Address You Should ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The best way of connecting to your cloud resources (for ex- ec2 instances) from your own data center (for eg- private cloud) is a VPC. Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address which can be accessed from your datacenter. Hence, you can access your public cloud resources, as if they were on your own network.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>41. Explain What Happens When I Reboot An Ec2 Instance ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Rebooting an instance is like rebooting a PC. The hard disk isn’t affected. You don’t return to the image’s original state, but the contents of the hard disks are those before the reboot.

Rebooting isn’t associated with billing. Billing starts when you instantiate an image and stops when you terminate it. Rebooting in between hasn’t any effect.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>44. What Are Spot Instances In Amazon Ec2 ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In Amazon EC2, we can even bid for getting a computing instance. Any instance procured by bidding is a Spot Instance. Multiple users bid for an EC2 Instance. Once the bid price exceeds the Spot price, the user with the highest bid gets it. As long as their bid price remains higher than the Spot price, they can keep using it.

Spot price varies with the supply and demand. Once Spot price exceeds Bid price, the instance will be taken back from the user.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>45. What Is The Difference Between A Spot Instance And A Demand Instance On Ec2 ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
“On-Demand” instances allow the user to use the compute by hour without requiring long term commitment. There are no guarantees that the user will always be able to launch specific instance types in an availability zone, though AWS tries it’s best to meet the needs. This service is preferable for POCs and they do not suffer an interruption of the service(by AWS) like Spot instances.

“Spot” instances are a bid_for_low_price version of On-Demand instances, but could be shut down by AWS anytime the Spot instance price goes higher than bid price. Spot price fluctuates based on the supply and demand of the capacity. It’s essentially the leftover capacity of AWS to be used. There is no difference in the performance compared to On-Demand instances and is usually cheaper than On-demand instances as there is no guarantee provided over the availability. The user can choose a start time and end time for the instances or can make a persistent request(no end time specified) for this service. This service is preferable for computing needs which are not tied to any deadlines, computing needs are large and the interruption of service is acceptable.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>46. What Are The Main Features Of Classic Load Balancer In Ec2 ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
<strong>Some of the main features of Classic Load Balancer (CLB) in Amazon EC2 are as follows:</strong>

<strong>Health Check:</strong> Based on the result of Health Check, Classic Load Balancer can decide to route the traffic. If any instance has unhealthy results, CLB will not route the traffic to that instance.

<strong>Security:</strong> We can create security groups for CLB in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With these features, it is easy to implement secure load balancing within a network.

<strong>High Availability:</strong> With CLB, we can distribute traffic among EC2 instances in single or multiple Availability Zones. This helps in providing very high scale of availability for the incoming traffic.

<strong>Sticky Sessions:</strong> CLB also supports sticky session by using cookies. The sticky sessions make sure that the traffic from a user is always routed to the same instance so that user gets seamless experience.

<strong>IPv6:</strong> CLB also support Internet Protocol version 6.

<strong>Operational Monitoring:</strong> We can also perform operational monitoring CLB and collect statistics on request count, latency etc. These metrics can be monitored in CloudWatch.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>48. What Is A Placement Group In Ec2 ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
AWS provides an option of creating a Placement Group in EC2 to logically group the instances within as single Availability Zone.

We get the benefits of low network latency and high network throughput by using a Placement Group.

Placement Group is a free option as of now. When we stop an instance, it will run in same Placement Group in restart at a later point of time.

The biggest limitation of Placement Group is that we cannot add Instances from multiple availability zones to one Placement Group.
