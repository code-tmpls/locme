<div><b>2. Explain different ways of creating a thread. Which one would you prefer and why?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
There are three ways that can be used in order for a Thread to be created:
<ul>
<li>A class may extend the <code><b>Thread</b></code> class.</li>
<li>A class may implement the <code><b>Runnable</b></code> interface.</li>
<li>An application can use the <code><b>Executor</b></code> framework, in order to create a thread pool.</li>
</ul>
The <code><b>Runnable</b></code> interface is preferred, as it does not require an object to inherit the <code><b>Thread</b></code> class. In case 
your application design requires multiple inheritance, only interfaces can help you. Also, the thread pool is very efficient and can be implemented and 
used very easily.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In Java programming, each object has a lock. A thread can acquire the lock for an object by using the synchronized keyword.

<div><b>5. How does thread synchronization occurs inside a monitor ? What levels of synchronization can you apply?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The JVM uses locks in conjunction with monitors. A monitor is basically a guardian that watches over a sequence of synchronized 
code and ensuring that only one thread at a time executes a synchronized piece of code. Each monitor is associated with an object 
reference. The thread is not allowed to execute the code until it obtains the lock.

<i>Example :</i> 
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">Thread t= new Thread();</code></pre>
In the above example <code><b>t</b></code> is in new state. The thread is created but not in active state to make it active we
need to call <code><b>start()</b></code> method on it.</li>
<li><b>Runnable state :</b><br/><br/> A thread can be in the runnable state in either of the following two ways :
<ol type="a">
<li>When the start method is invoked or</li>
<li>A thread can also be in runnable state after coming back from blocked or sleeping or waiting state.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Running state :</b><br/><br/> If thread scheduler allocates cpu time, then the thread will be in running state.</li>
<li><b>Waited /Blocking/Sleeping state:</b><br/><br/>
In this state the thread can be made temporarily inactive for a short period of time. A thread can be in
the above state in any of the following ways:
<ol type="a">
<li>The thread waits to acquire lock of an object.</li>
<li>The thread waits for another thread to complete.</li>
<li>The thread waits for notification of other thread.</li>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Lock also called monitor is used to prevent access to a shared resource by multiple threads.<br/><br/>
A lock is associated to shared resource. Whenever a thread wants to access a shared resource if must first acquire a lock . If already a lock has been 
acquired by other it canâ€™t access that shared resource. At this moment the thread has to wait until another thread releases the lock on shared resource. 
To lock an object we use synchronization in java.<br/><br/>
A lock protects section of code allowing only one thread to execute at at a time.

If we want a method of object to be accessed by single thread at a time we declare that method with
synchronized keyword.<br/><br/>
<b>Syntax :</b><br/><br/>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs xml">public synchronized void methodName() {
 // ...

To execute synchronized method first lock has to be acquired on that object. Once synchronized method is called lock will be automatically acquired on that 
method when no other thread has lock on that method. Once lock has been acquired then synchronized method gets executed. Once synchronized
method execution completes automatically lock will be released. The prerequisite to execute a synchronized method is to acquire lock before method execution. 
If there is a lock already acquired by any other thread it waits till the other thread completes.

work. That is the reason we may not see the impact of interrupt call immediately.<br/><br/>
Initially thread has a boolean property(interrupted status) false. So when we call interrupt() method 
status would set to true. This causes the current thread to continue its work and does not have impact 
immediately.<br/><br/>
If a thread is in sleeping or waiting status (i.e thread has executed wait () or sleep() method) thread gets
interrupted it stops what it is doing and throws an interrupted exception. This is reason we need to handle
interrupted exception with throws or try/ catch block.

<div><b>48. Explain about interthread communication and how it takes place in java?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Usually threads are created to perform different unrelated tasks but there may be situations where they
may perform related tasks. Interthread communication in java is done with the help of following three
methods :<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>wait()</li>
<li>notify()</li>
<li>notifyAll()</li>
</ol>

<div><b>49. Explain wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods of object class ?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
<ul>
<li><b>wait() :</b> wait() method() makes the thread current thread sleeps and releases the lock until some other
thread acquires the lock and calls notify().</li>
<li><b>notify() :</b> notify() method wakes up the thread that called wait on the same object.</li>
<li><b>notfiyAll() :</b> notifyAll() method wakes up all the threads that are called wait() on the same object. The
highest priority threads will run first.</li>
</ul>
All the above three methods are in object class and are called only in synchronized context.<br/><br/>
All the above three methods must handle InterruptedException by using throws clause or by using try catch clause.

<div><b>50. Explain why wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods are in Object class rather than in thread class?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
First to know why they are in object class we should know what <code><b>wait()</b></code>, <code><b>notify()</b></code>, <code><b>notifyAll()</b></code> methods do.<br/><br/>
<code><b>wait()</b></code>, <code><b>notify()</b></code>, <code><b>notifyAll()</b></code> methods are object level methods they are called on same 
object.wait(), notify(), notifyAll() are called on an shared object so to they are kept in object class rather than thread class.

<div><b>51. Explain IllegalMonitorStateException and when it will be thrown?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown when wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are called in non synchronized context. Wait(), notify(),notifyAll() must always 
be called in synchronized context other wise we get this run time exception.
<!-- Answer ::: END -->
</div>
</div>

<div><b>52. when wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods are called does it releases the lock or holds the acquired lock?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods are always called in synchronized context. When these methods are called in synchronized context.<br/><br/>
So when they enter first in synchronized context thread acquires the lock on current object. When wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods are called lock 
is released on that object.

<div><b>54. What are Thread groups?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Thread Groups are group of threads and other thread groups. It is a way of grouping threads so that 
actions can be performed on set of threads for easy maintenance and security purposes.<br/><br/>
For example we can start and stop all thread groups. We rarely use thread group class. By default all the 
threads that are created belong to default thread group of the main thread. Every thread belongs to a 
thread group. Threads that belong to a particular thread group cannot modify threads belonging to 
another thread group.

<div><b>55. What are Thread local variables?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Thread local variables are variables associated to a particular thread rather than object. We declare
ThreadLocal object as private static variable in a class. Everytime a new thread accesses object by using
getter or setter we are accesing copy of object. Whenever a thread calls get or set method of
ThreadLocal instance a new copy is associated with particular object.

<div><b>56. What are Daemon threads in java?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Daemon threads are threads which run in background. These are service threads and works for the
benefit of other threads. Garbage collector is one of the good example for daemon threads.
By default all threads are non daemon. Daemon nature of a thread can be inherited. If parent thread is
daemon , child thread also inherits daemon nature of thread.

<div><b>57. How to make a non daemon thread as daemon?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
By default all threads are non daemon. We can make non daemon nature of thread to daemon by using 
setDaemon() method. The important point to note here we can call setDaemon() only before start() 
method is called on it. If we call setDaemon() after start() method an IllegalThreadStateException will be 
thrown.
