<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
There are ten main benefits of Cloud Computing :
<ol>
<li><b>Flexibility :</b> The businesses that have fluctuating bandwidth demands need the flexibility of Cloud Computing. If you need high bandwidth, you 
can scale up your cloud capacity. When you do not need high bandwidth, you can just scale down. There is no need to be tied into an inflexible fixed capacity
infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Disaster Recovery :</b> Cloud Computing provides robust backup and recovery solutions that are hosted in cloud. Due to this there is no need to 
spend extra resources on homegrown disaster recovery. It also saves time in setting up disaster recovery.</li>
<li><b>Automatic Software Updates :</b> Most of the Cloud providers give automatic software updates. This reduces the extra task of installing new software
version and always catching up with the latest software installs.</li>
<li><b>Low Capital Expenditure :</b> In Cloud computing the model is Pay as you Go. This means there is very less upfront capital expenditure. There is a 
variable payment that is based on the usage.</li>
<li><b>Collaboration :</b> In a cloud environment, applications can be shared between teams. This increases collaboration and communication among team 
members.</li>
<li><b>Remote Work :</b> Cloud solutions provide flexibility of working remotely. There is no on site work. One can just connect from anywhere and start 
working.</li>
<li><b>Security :</b> Cloud computing solutions are more secure than regular onsite work. Data stored in local servers and computers is prone to security 
attacks. In Cloud Computing, there are very few loose ends. Cloud providers give a secure working environment to its users.</li>
<li><b>Document Control :</b> Once the documents are stored in a common repository, it increases the visibility and transparency among companies and their 
clients. Since there is one shared copy, there are fewer chances of discrepancies.</li>
<li><b>Competitive Pricing :</b> In Cloud computing there are multiple players, so they keep competing among themselves and provide very good pricing. This 
comes out much cheaper compared to other options.</li>
<li><b>Environment Friendly :</b> Cloud computing saves precious environmental resources also. By not blocking the resources and bandwidth.</li>
</ol>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>442. What is On-demand computing in Cloud Computing?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
On-demand Computing is the latest model in enterprise systems. It is related to Cloud computing. It means IT resources can be provided on demand by a
Cloud provider.<br/><br/>
In an enterprise system demand for computing resources varies from time to time. In such a scenario, On-demand computing makes sure that servers and IT
resources are provisioned to handle the increase/decrease in demand.<br/><br/>
A cloud provider maintains a poll of resources. The pool of resources contains networks, servers, storage, applications and services. This pool can serve the
varying demand of resources and computing by various enterprise clients.<br/><br/>
There are many concepts like- grid computing, utility computing, autonomic computing etc. that are similar to on-demand computing.<br/><br/>
This is the most popular trend in computing model as of now.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>443. What are the different layers of Cloud computing?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Three main layers of Cloud computing are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) :</b> IAAS providers give low-level abstractions of physical devices. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example
of IAAS. AWS provides EC2 for computing, S3 buckets for storage etc.<br/><br/>
Mainly the resources in this layer are hardware like memory, processor speed, network bandwidth etc.</li>
<li><b>Platform as a Service (PAAS) :</b> PAAS providers offer managed services like Rails, Django etc. One good example of PAAS is Google App Engineer. These
are the environments in which developers can develop sophisticated software with ease.<br/><br/>
Developers just focus on developing software, whereas scaling and performance is handled by PAAS provider.</li>
<li><b>Software as a Service (SAAS): SAAS provider offer an actual working software application to clients.<br/><br/> 
Salesforce and Github are two good examples of SAAS. They hide the underlying details of the software and just provide an interface to work on the system. 
Behind the scenes the version of Software can be easily changed.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>445. What is the benefit of Platform as a Service?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a kind of cloud computing service. A PaaS provider offers a platform on which clients can develop, run and manage
applications without the need of building the infrastructure.<br/><br/>
In PAAS clients save time by not creating and managing infrastructure environment associated with the app that they want to develop.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>446. What are the main advantages of PaaS?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
The advantages of PaaS are :
<ul>
<li>It allows development work on higher level programming with very less complexity.</li>
<li>Teams can focus on just the development of the application that makes the application very effective.</li>
<li>Maintenance and enhancement of the application is much easier.</li>
<li>It is suitable for situations in which multiple developers work on a single project but are not co-located.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>447. What is the main disadvantage of PaaS?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Biggest disadvantage of PaaS is that a developer can only use the tools that PaaS provider makes available. A developer cannot use the full range of
conventional tools.<br/><br/>
Some PaaS providers lock in the clients in their platform. This also decreases the flexibility of clients using PaaS.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>448. What are the different deployment models in Cloud computing?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Cloud computing supports following deployment models :
<ul>
<li><b>Private Cloud :</b> Some companies build their private cloud. A private cloud is a fully functional platform that is owned, operated and used 
by only one organization.<br/><br/>
Primary reason for private cloud is security. Many companies feel secure in private cloud. The other reasons for building private cloud are strategic
decisions or control of operations.<br/><br/>
There is also a concept of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). In VPC, private cloud is built and operated by a hosting company. But it is exclusively used by one
organization.</li>
<li><b>Public Cloud :</b> There are cloud platforms by some companies that are open for general public as well as big companies for use and deployment.<br/> 
E.g. Google Apps, Amazon Web Services etc.<br/><br/>
The public cloud providers focus on layers and application like- cloud application, infrastructure management etc. In this model resources are shared
among different organizations.</li>
<li><b>Hybrid Cloud :</b> The combination of public and private cloud is known as Hybrid cloud. This approach provides benefits of both the approaches- private
and public cloud. So it is very robust platform.<br/>
A client gets functionalities and features of both the cloud platforms. By using Hybrid cloud an organization can create its own cloud as well as they 
can pass the control of their cloud to another third party.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>449. What is the difference between Scalability and Elasticity?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle the increased load on its current hardware and software resources. In a highly scalable system it is 
possible to increase the workload without increasing the resource capacity. Scalability
supports any sudden surge in the demand/traffic with current set of resources.<br/><br/> 
Elasticity is the ability of a system to increase the workload by increasing the hardware/software resources dynamically. Highly elastic systems can handle
the increased demand and traffic by dynamically commission and decommission resources. Elasticity is an important characteristic of Cloud
Computing applications. Elasticity means how well your architecture is adaptable to workload in real time.<br/><br/> 
E.g. If in a system, one server can handle 100 users, 2 servers can handle 200 users and 10 servers can handle 1000 users. But in case for adding every X
users, if you need 2X the amount of servers, then it is not a scalable design.<br/><br/> 
Let say, you have just one user login every hour on your site. Your one server can handle this load. But, if suddenly, 1000 users login at once, can your
system quickly start new web servers on the fly to handle this load? Your design is elastic if it can handle such sudden increase in traffic so quickly.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>450. What is Software as a Service?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Software as Service is a category of cloud computing in which Software is centrally hosted and it is licensed on a subscription basis. It is also known as
On-demand software. Generally, clients access the software by using a thinclient like a web browser.<br/><br/> 
Many applications like Google docs, Microsoft office etc. provide SaaS model for their software.<br/><br/> 
The benefit of SaaS is that a client can add more users on the fly based on its current needs. And client does not need to install or maintain any software on
its premises to use this software.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>451. What are the different types of Datacenters in Cloud computing?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Cloud computing consists of different types of Datacenters linked in a grid structure. The main types of Datacenters in Cloud computing are :<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Containerized Datacenter :</b><br/><br/>
As the name suggests, containerized datacenter provides high level of customization for an organization. These are traditional kind of datacenters. We
can choose the different types of servers, memory, network and other infrastructure resources in this datacenter. Also we have to plan temperature
control, network management and power management in this kind of datacenter.</li>
<li><b>Low-Density Datacenters :</b><br/><br/>
In a Low-density datacenter, we get high level of performance. In such a datacenter if we increase the density of servers, the issue with power comes.
With high density of servers, the area gets heated. In such a scenario, effective heat and power management is done. To reach high level of performance, we
have to optimize the number of servers’ in the datacenter.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>452. Explain the various modes of Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud environment?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Software as a Service (SaaS) is used to offer different kinds of software applications in a Cloud environment. Generally these are offered on
subscription basis. Different modes of SaaS are :
<ul>
<li><b>Simple multi-tenancy :</b><br/><br/> In this setup, each client gets its own resources. These resources are not shared with other clients. It is more 
secure option, since there is no sharing of resources. But it an inefficient option, since for each client more money is needed to scale it with the 
rising demands. Also it takes time to scale up the application in this mode.</li>
<li><b>Fine grain multi-tenancy :</b><br/><br/> In this mode, the feature provided to each client is same. The resources are shared among multiple clients. 
It is an efficient mode of cloud service, in which data is kept private among different clients but computing resources are shared. Also it is easier and 
quicker to scale up the SaaS implementation for different clients.</li>

<div class="appQuestion"><b>453. What are the important things to care about in Security in a cloud environment?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In a cloud-computing environment, security is one of the most important aspects.<br/><br/>
With growing concern of hacking, every organization wants to make its software system and data secure. Since in a cloud computing environment,
Software and hardware is not on the premises of an organization, it becomes more important to implement the best security practices.<br/><br/>
Organizations have to keep their Data most secure during the transfer between two locations. Also they have to keep data secure when it is stored at a
location. Hackers can hack into application or they can get an unauthorized copy of the data. So it becomes important to encrypt the data during transit as
well as during rest to protect it from unwanted hackers.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Different areas of Security management in cloud are as follows :
<ul>
<li><b>Identity Management :</b> This aspect creates different level of users, roles and their credentials to access the services in cloud.</li>
<li><b>Access Control: In this area, we create multiple levels of permissions and access areas that can be given to a user or role for accessing a service 
in cloud environment.</li>
<li><b>Authentication: In this area, we check the credentials of a user and confirm that it is the correct user. Generally this is done by user password and 
multi-factor authentication like-verification by a one-time use code on cell phone.</li>
<li><b>Authorization: In this aspect, we check for the permissions that are given to a user or role. If a user is authorized to access a service, they are 
allowed to use it in the cloud environment.</li>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
Costs in a Cloud based data center are different from a traditional data center.<br/><br/>
Main cost factors of cloud based data center are as follows :
<ul>
<li><b>Labor cost :</b> We need skilled staff that can work with the cloud-based datacenter that we have selected for our operation. Since cloud is not 
a very old technology, it may get difficult to get the right skill people for handling cloud based datacenter.</li>
<li><b>Power cost :</b> In some cloud operations, power costs are borne by the client. Since it is a variable cost, it can increase with the increase in 
scale and usage.</li>
<li><b>Computing cost :</b> The biggest cost in Cloud environment is the cost that we pay to Cloud provider for giving us computing resources. This cost 
is much higher compared to the labor or power costs.</li>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In a cloud-computing environment we pay for the services that we use. So main criteria to measure a cloud based service its usage.<br/><br/> 
For computing resource we measure by usage in terms of time and the power of computing resource.<br/><br/> 
For a storage resource we measure by usage in terms of bytes (giga bytes) and bandwidth used in data transfer.<br/><br/> 
Another important aspect of measuring a cloud service is its availability. A cloud provider has to specify the service level agreement (SLA) for the time
for which service will be available in cloud.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>458. How a traditional datacenter is different from a cloud environment?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In a traditional datacenter the cost of increasing the scale of computing environment is much higher than a Cloud computing environment. Also in a
traditional data center, there are not much benefits of scaling down the operation when demand decreases. Since most of the expenditure is in capital
spent of buying servers etc., scaling down just saves power cost, which is very less compared to other fixed costs.<br/><br/> 
Also in a Cloud environment there is no need to higher a large number of operations staff to maintain the datacenter. Cloud provider takes care of
maintaining and upgrading the resources in Cloud environment.<br/><br/> 
With a traditional datacenter, people cost is very high since we have to hire a large number of technical operation people for in-house datacenter.

<div class="appQuestion"><b>459. How will you optimize availability of your application in a Cloud environment?</b></div>
<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item appAnswer">
<!-- Answer ::: START -->
In a Cloud environment, it is important to optimize the availability of an application by implementing disaster recovery strategy. For disaster recovery
we create a backup application in another location of cloud environment. In case of complete failure at a data center we use the disaster recovery site to
run the application.<br/><br/> 
Another aspect of cloud environment is that servers often fail or go down. In such a scenario it is important to implement the application in such a way that
we just kill the slow server and restart another server to handle the traffic seamlessly.
